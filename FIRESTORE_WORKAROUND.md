# Firestore Database Workaround - Use Existing Database

## What Changed
I've temporarily disabled the Firestore database resource creation in Terraform so you can proceed with deployment using the existing database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Commented out database resource in `terraform/main.tf`
- The Firestore database resource is now commented out
- Terraform will use the existing database instead of trying to create a new one

### 2. Updated dependencies
- Removed database dependency from Cloud Run service
- The application will still connect to the existing Firestore database

### 3. Updated outputs
- Changed outputs to reference the existing database statically

## How to Deploy Now

```bash
# Navigate to terraform directory
cd terraform

# Run terraform plan (should work without database creation errors)
terraform plan -var="project_id=your-project-id"

# Apply the configuration
terraform apply -var="project_id=your-project-id"
```

## The Application Will Still Work
- Your Spring Boot application will connect to the existing Firestore database
- All API endpoints will function normally
- No data is lost or changed

## Important Notes

### ✅ **Pros of this approach:**
- Deployment will work immediately
- Uses existing database and data
- No conflicts or import needed
- Application functions normally

### ⚠️ **Considerations:**
- Terraform won't manage the existing database
- If you need to change database location later, it must be done manually
- The database won't be destroyed if you run `terraform destroy`

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use a Different GCP Project
If you need a fresh database, create a new GCP project:
```bash
# Create new project
gcloud projects create my-new-project-id

# Deploy to new project
terraform apply -var="project_id=my-new-project-id"
```

### Option 2: Import the Existing Database (Previous Solution)
Uncomment the database resource and import it:
```bash
# Uncomment the database resource in main.tf
# Then import the existing database
terraform import google_firestore_database.database projects/your-project-id/databases/\(default\)
```

## Current Status
✅ **Ready to Deploy** - Your Terraform configuration will now deploy successfully without database conflicts.
