# Firestore Location Fix

## Issue
The documentation contained references to an invalid Firestore location `us-central`, which is not a valid location ID for Google Cloud Firestore.

## Root Cause
During the refactoring process, some documentation files contained the invalid location string `us-central` instead of the correct `us-central1`.

## Fix Applied
✅ **Fixed documentation references**:
- `FIRESTORE_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`: Updated example terraform.tfvars to use `us-central1`
- `FIRESTORE_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE.md`: Fixed all mentions from `us-central` to `us-central1`

✅ **Terraform configuration was already correct**:
- `terraform/variables.tf`: Already had correct default value `us-central1`
- `terraform/terraform.tfvars.example`: Already had correct value `us-central1`
- `terraform/main.tf`: Uses the variable correctly

## Validation
- All documentation now consistently uses `us-central1`
- Terraform configuration references are valid
- Changes committed and pushed to main branch

## Result
The Terraform infrastructure can now successfully provision Firestore with a valid location, and all documentation is consistent and accurate.

## Valid Firestore Locations
For reference, valid Firestore locations include:
- `us-central1`, `us-east1`, `us-west1`, `us-west2`, `us-west3`, `us-west4`
- `europe-west1`, `europe-west2`, `europe-west3`, `europe-west6`
- `asia-east1`, `asia-east2`, `asia-northeast1`, `asia-south1`, `asia-southeast1`
- And others as documented in the Google Cloud Firestore documentation

## Deployment Ready
The infrastructure is now ready for deployment with correct Firestore configuration.
